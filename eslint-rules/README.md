# Custom ESLint Rules

(Adapted from https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1a65d036ef057b07a6b15f5604e399f91bc5ed73/scripts/eslint-rules/README.md)
This is a dummy npm package that allows us to treat it as an `eslint-plugin`. It's not actually published.

**If you modify this rule, you must re-run `npm install ./eslint-rules` for it to take effect.**
